to do:
*NSF
*class prep (notes, assignment)
*get Atlas data (max efforts)
*observers for Atlas arms... in simu first

*Jacobian for stair climbing

---Jacobian:

shift weight w/ feet stationary;
 keep hands at fixed location in world frame (i.e., stationary w/rt feet)

issues: 
given state, and various J(q), compute ideal coupled incremental motion cmds
unplanned droop-> will need hand corrections
COULD compute COM solution...or could just lean in direction of correction (try this first)

WANT: shift weight over chosen ankle

DO: displace pelvis to null out COM err w/rt chosen ankle...
    compute arm motions separately;

how to shift pelvis: 
  say desire to put wt over left ankle
  say COM is too far to right (-y) and too far fwd (+x)

say have J_ang and J_trans(q) for rf and lf
  express these in world coords;

 want pelvis motion of (dx,dy) w/rt world
 equiv is want (-dx,-dy) of left foot and right foot w/rt world
 also want dPhi=0_vec of both feet

 choose dz=0 for both feet (if jnt limits allow)
 thus have b_vec for right leg--> dq_rleg, and b_vec for left leg (identical)--> dq_lleg
 6DOF J--> no null space; unique soln;
  SOLVED

 given expectation for pelvis motion (dx, dy, 0) and dPhi_pelvis=0, how to control arms?
  desire dp left arm = dp right arm = (-dx, -dy, -dz)_pelvis_cmd;
  ALSO want dPhi of hand = 0_vec for both arms;

 if back joints are frozen, -> J_larm and J_rarm are 6x6, so get unique soln (if jnts allow)

-------------dealing with joint limits----------
have pelvis-z DOF
can allow hands to rotate about railing grasp cylinder
have 3DOF torso options (though want to keep these small perturbations)

-----------adjusting hands on railings----------
hand relaxation behavior:  
  *move to location of computed balance over stance ankle(s)
  *lift one hand until zero contact; re-approach and grab
  *do same with other hand

---phases------
start: balanced on 2 feet on single step w/ hand on railings
 1) move hands to prepare for next step
 2) shift wt over (e.g.) left ankle, maintaining grasp on railings
 3) lift right foot and place on next step
 4) raise pelvis to extend left leg(?)
 5) shift wt to right ankle
 6) lift left foot and place on step
 7) shift wt to both feet
 8) extend legs (stand)
  ---repeat from (1)

-- phase 1-------
