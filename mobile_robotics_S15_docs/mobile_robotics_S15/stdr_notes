Did this to run STDR simulator:

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-stdr-simulator

roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch


rostopic pub  robot0/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0,0,0]' '[0,0,1]'

rostopic pub  robot0/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0,0,0]' '[0,0,0.1]'

created test package:
  hku_create_pkg stdr_hku_vel_cmd_pub roscpp std_msgs geometry_msgs
  
  put in .../src file this test code:  
     example_cmd_vel_publisher.cpp
  Edited CmakeLists to add this executable

  compiled with:   hku_make stdr_hku_vel_cmd_pub
