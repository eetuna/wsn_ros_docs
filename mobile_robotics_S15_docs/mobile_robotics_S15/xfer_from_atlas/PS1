PS1:

1) get the repository:
see notes at:  https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
fork the repository at: https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_376_student
 (see the README file there)

"clone" this repository into your ros_workspace directory
(may need to create this directory and edit .bashrc file for ROS setups)


2) run the simple 2-dimensional robot simulator, stdr:
  roslaunch cwru_376_launchers stdr_glennan_2.launch
 along with the exampel velocity commander:
  rosrun example_robot_commander robot_commander 

3) Edit the file ".../example_robot_commander/src/example_robot_commander.cpp"

Make the robot depart from the elevator, turn right down the hallway, and turn right towards the
vending machines.

Make a movie of your result (using Kazaam)

upload your edited cpp program and your movie to Blackboard.
