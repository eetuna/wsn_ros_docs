goals:

point-cloud connects to opencv

mouse selects points in 2D

implies points in 3D 

interpret in some (utorso? pelvis?) frame

move hand to target point (along straight line?)

sense contact and stop??

have arm move along line of sight?


Jacobian w/rt sensor frame?

w/ mouse clicks, found point-cloud coords say: z is depth (into scene), +x is to the right, +y is down

Point clouds are generated in the optical frame of the left imager (X Right, Y Down, Z out).
