A simple OpenCV example (and handy utility) that saves snapshots of an image topic to a bitmap.

compile with: rosmake snapshot

To use, need a camera image topic being published.
E.g., start up the atlas simulator (such as with: roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_drc_vehicle_fire_hose.launch)



in a terminal, change to the directory where you want to store your snapshots, then start the snapshot program.
To use the default topic of: //multisense_sl/camera/right/image_rect_color, run with:

  rosrun snapshot snapshot

To specify an alternative camera topic, include a command-line argument. 
E.g., to get rectified color images from the left eye, do: 

  rosrun snapshot snapshot in:=//multisense_sl/camera/left/image_rect_color

"snapshot" will then subscribe to the image topic (default or command-line) and 
prompt the user to enter "1" to take and save a snapshot, or enter "0" to quit the program.

Each time "1" is entered, the received image will be saved to disk as a *.bmp file in the current directory
(from which "snapshot" was run).

Each saved picture gets saved as: snapshotN.bmp
 where "N" is incremented each time, starting from snapshot1.bmp.

If you already have images in the current directory with similar names (e.g. snapshot1.bmp), these will get overwritten.

You can also view the saved images by subscribing to the topic "snapshot_out".  To do so, in another terminal, run:
  rosrun image_view image_view image:=/snapshot_out

The saved images can be examined with another program.  E.g., you can:
start "gimp" (if installed, will be under Applications->Graphics->GIMP Image Editor)
In the GIMP main window, do File->Open... and navigate to an image of interest and open it.
In the GIMP Toolbox panel, you can select the Color Picker Tool (looks like an eye dropper),
In the Color Picker panel,
  click "sample average", 
  increase the radius to some desired value for sampling
  click "Pick only"
  click "Use info window"

In the loaded/displayed image, your mouse will look like an eye dropper.
Click on some region, and the Color Picker Information window will show the color information
 (e.g., clicking on the sky will yield something like Red: 144, Green: 161, Blue: 212)

This color information can be used to design a program to recognize regions of specific color ranges
