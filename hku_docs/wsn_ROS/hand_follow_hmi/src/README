--------------to run----------------------
start the atlas simulator drcsim-2.0 with:
   roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_sandia_hands.launch

compile this package (atlas_jnt_ctl) with:
   rosmake atlas_jnt_ctl

note: rqrs edits to CMakeLists.txt, per Atlas tutorial (see accompanying CMakeLists file)
also: make sure manifest has the necessary dependencies (see accompanying manifest file) 

start this node running with:
  rosrun atlas_jnt_ctl atlas_jnt_ctl

Atlas should fall backwards, then from its back on the ground, sit up

------------------------

Tried to do all initializations in constructor of AtlasJointControl, but could not make callbacks work
 can use a member fnc for callback, but have to set it up in the parent fnc (main)

problem with listener:  can't pass in a listener to class constructor

added class SmootJointSpaceMove
added class MoveSequencer

initialized array of goal states in MoveSequencer to make robot fall backwards then sit up
  looks good.


---------------------ToDO----------------------
make goal move array a circular queue

get Jacobian computations in a class

create a SmoothCartesianSpaceMove...  moving attractor? (uses Jacobians)
demo arms moving in a straight line

extend to knee Jacobian for crawling
