notes on one_shot_move package:

Useful utility for moving the robot to a specified pose.  Skips use of the joint sequencer.
Manually edit "one_shot_move.cpp" to specify the desired joint angles.
May specify all 28 body angles, or may specify only a subset.
The unspecified angles will be commanded to remain at the current pose of the robot.

To use this package, 

*edit file one_shot_move.cpp
*specify the goal joint angles of those joints to be moved, e.g.:
  move the neck to 1.0rad by editing the following line in one_shot_move.cpp

  // EDIT HERE XXXXXXX  specified desired new angles (only those different from current pose)
  goalAngles[neck_ay] = 1.0;  //tilt the head via the neck

  // DONE WITH EDITS XXXX

*do: 
  rosmake one_shot_move

*if robot simulator is not already running, do:
  roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_sandia_hands.launch, 
OR:
  roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_drc_vehicle_fire_hose.launch


*do: 
  rosrun one_shot_move one_shot_move


EXAMPLE:  moving the neck to 1.0 (bending down) is useful for:

  roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_drc_vehicle_fire_hose.launch

and in a separate window:
  rostopic pub --once /drc_world/robot_enter_car geometry_msgs/Pose '{}'

this will place Atlas in the vehicle.
Bending the neck downwards then has a useful view of the steering wheel and shifter

to visualize, do:

  rosrun rviz rviz

*in .Global Options: set fixed frame to /pelvis
*click "add" button and choose: rviz->PointCloud2 (and click "OK")
*in "Displays" panel, under PointCloud2" item, click to the right of "Topic" and
   choose: multisense_sl->camera->points2 (click "OK")
*still in "Displays", still under "PointCloud2", click to right of Color Transformer, 
   and choose: RGB8

Will now be able to see the steering wheel, gear shifter, dash, tops of knees, pedal, ...
