package to test/learn "Eigen"

note #include's in test_eigen.cpp
dependencies in manifest
statements in CMakeLists.txt

example code demonstrates matrix/vector math, and how to solve systems of equations
(two methods demonstrated).

Can do M*x, x.norm(), x.dot(y), x.cross(y)

this test worked--successfully solved 6x6 matrix equations

use this for crawling Jacobian
