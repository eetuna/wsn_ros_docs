new process, as of Nov 24, 2013

1) start up Atlas with:
drill task:
VRC_CHEATS_ENABLED=1 roslaunch hku_worlds task_6.launch  (new launch file; includes hand frames; enables pelvis pinning)

valve task:
VRC_CHEATS_ENABLED=1 roslaunch hku_worlds task_7.launch  (new launch file; includes hand frames; enables pelvis pinning)

2) move Atlas in Gazebo view

3) pin the pelvis:
rostopic pub --once /atlas/mode std_msgs/String '{data: "pinned_with_gravity"}'

4) rosrun rviz rviz
   (should find grasp frames on hands--show these)
    set fixed frame to "pelvis"
    add->axes->right_grasp_frame
    add->PointCloud2->/multisense_sl/camera/points2 (optional)
    add->LaserScan->/multisense_sl/laser/scan
      increase decay time; try ColorTransformer: AxisColor with Axis = X  
      turn off autocompute value; try min value = 0.8, max value = 1 (tune these to your liking)

5) start spindle turning:
   rostopic pub --once /multisense_sl/set_spindle_speed std_msgs/Float64 '{data: 3.0}'

6) rosrun LLJSV5... (answer Q's)
  rosrun lowLevelJointServoV3 lowLevelJointServoV3 

7) rosrun behavior server:
   rosrun behavior_server behavior_server

8) prep pose: cd to /ros_workspace/elec7078/rosbuild/elec7078_newman/traj_files (or any alternative you choose)
   rosrun play_file play_file prep_valve_grab.traj  (or any trajectory file of your choice)
     (robot will move arms to a preparatory pose)

9) start the jacobian action server:
  rosrun jacobian_move_behavior rhand_jacobian_move_behavior

10) start the interactive marker node:
   rosrun grasping_elec7078 grasp_goal

11) in rviz, add->interactiveMarkers->grasping/im/update
      the interactive marker should appear in front of the pelvis.  It is much smaller now, so you may need to look closely for it.

12) test the interactive marker;  observer output from the terminal of step (10) while moving the marker in rviz.  
    You should see the coordinates change.

13) Start the GUI panel;  you MAY need to tell the system to search for the GUI description by running:
       rqt --force-discover  (but you should only need to do this once, if at all), then:
     rosrun grasping_elec7078 grasping.py

The GUI panel has features that are grayed out.  You will only need the "Execute" button.
  When you press this button, the most recent marker pose will be sent to the action server as a goal request.

Please note that, at present, what the action server does with this information is VERY WRONG.  You need to add
code for a more intelligent response.

The current Jacobian publisher does not publish Jacobians with respect to the new grasp frames on the hands, so
you would want to use a version of "vlad's fancy solver" and refer to the new frame names (e.g. right_grasp_frame).
