*assignment: move right to open valve

1) run a playfile traj script to pre-position right arm

2) start up jacobian pgm 1 to move right hand to desired coords/orientation
  (talks to LLJC);
   Need to find pose that is reachable

3) run playfile cmd to close hand

4) start up jacobian pgm to rotate hand CCW about pelvis -x axis until jnt limit (turn valve CCW)

5) run playfile to open hand;

6) move palm slightly in -x direction (release valve)

7) rotate hand CW about pelvis x axis until jnt limit

8) move +x dir to regrasp position

9) run playfile to close hand

10) re-run jacobian pgm to rotate valve CCW
