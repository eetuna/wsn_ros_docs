class list:  

prep excel printout for assignment 1:
make sure everyone has forked team_hku and shared with me

have:
Alex, Nian Xing, Eric, Yi Chen (Ken), Guangy Xu (Sue), Levi Ma, Sampson Tan, Ernest Cheung
missing: billbliss, Patrick, Du, Sharon, Frankie, (Rita, Helen)

go around and see hmwk 1 demos; make notes


-----Last time, did: Intro to ROS-----
  roscreate-pkg example_pkg roscpp std_msgs  (do this in ros_workspace, but not my fork)
  manifest.xml
  CMakeLists.txt
  code in "src" directory
  example minimal publisher
  rosmake minimal_nodes (in new example package?)
  roscore
  rosrun pkg node
  rostopic xxx
  rxgraph
  explain ROS_INFO() (in source code)
  rosrun both nodes (separately)
  rxgraph
  roslaunch: (refer to cheatsheet)
  rxconsole
  rosbag (record, then play w/ subscriber only; watch output in rxconsole)
  ----------------simulator/controller----------
  simulator: subscriber AND publisher
  rxplot
  rostopic pub for force_cmd
  minimal_controller:
   rostopic pub vel_cmd
   rxplot
 ---------------------
 an edit to README.md (on my fork)
 use git gui (commit, then push)
 demo that change shows up on bitbucket
 ----assignment: write trajectory commander for minimal simulator/controller-------
 go over assignment on-line
........

-----OUTLINE FOR SEPT 17-----------
*Modelling the Atlas robot document (explain URDF, links, joints, actuators, frames)
*atlas joints PDF
*atlas URDF display PDF
*open a URDF file
*ROS and DRC v2.pdf (14 pgs)
  gazebo server/client
  what gets simulated
  roslaunch atlas_utils ...
  simulated sensors (e.g. cameras)
  rosrun rviz rviz...and rviz settings
  rosnode list
  rostopic list
  rostopic hz atlas/atlas_state
  rosmsg show atlas_msgs/AtlasState
  
simple_joint_interface:  
  run pgm...demo; e.g, tilt head and show new view;  
  explain code and "go to current pose"
  demo: move arm and fall over

*go over reference pose and reference frames (pelvis frame, etc)

*launch w/ VRC_CHEATS_ENABLED and do rostopic pub ...

* go through joints/motions; w/ pelvis pinned

* need for better interface: streaming;

----defining custom messages---
see hku_msgs, low-level joint controller
more on messages; can make own messages; defer this

go over low_level_servo_control.cpp
go over sin_test_generator.cpp

describe how to rosbag
describe how to analyze

go over assignment
